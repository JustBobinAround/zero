# ZERO

The ZERO stack is my personal web stack. The goal of this stack is to
have a dependency free implementation of everything that I normally need for web
and application development. This library contains a wide variety of tools:

- [ ] Async Runtime
- [ ] HTTP 1.1 and 2 implementation
  - [ ] Server
  - [ ] Routing
    - [ ] Request extractor abstractions
- [ ] HTTPS/TLS implementation
- [ ] Custom fork of the fixi.js implementation
- [ ] HTML macro with fx attributes as first-class attributes
- [ ] Relational Database (spec still in developement)
  - [ ] Rust as schema system
- [ ] Low code macro system
